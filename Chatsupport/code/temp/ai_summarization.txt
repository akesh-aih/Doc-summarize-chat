# Requirement Document for AI-Based Document Summarization and Interaction in ECM

## Project Title
AI Integration for Document Summarization and Chat Interaction in ECM

## Objective
To implement an AI module within the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system that enables users to summarize selected documents and interact with the AI by asking specific questions. The AI module will generate concise summaries and provide accurate responses based on the shared document's content.

## Scope
The proposed solution will:
- Allow users to select a document stored in the ECM and summarize its content.
- Provide a conversational interface to query the summarized or original document.
- Operate seamlessly in the background using APIs.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Document Summarization
- Users can select any document stored in the ECM and initiate summarization by clicking a "Summarize" button.
- The AI module should analyze the document's content and generate a concise summary highlighting key points.
- The summary should maintain the context and accuracy of the original document.

### 2. Chat Interaction with Document
- Users can ask specific questions about the summarized document or the original content.
- The AI module should process user queries and provide precise, context-aware responses.
- The chatbot should reference the document's content for generating accurate answers.

### 3. API-Based Operation
- The entire process, from document summarization to query handling, will function in the background via APIs.
- APIs should:
  - Accept document data as input for summarization.
  - Handle user queries by referencing the shared document.
  - Return summarized content or query responses as output.

### 4. Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement
- Capture user feedback on summaries and chatbot responses.
- Use this feedback to improve the accuracy and relevance of the AI module over time.

### 5. Multi-Format Support
- The AI module should support summarization and interaction for various document formats, including PDF, Word, and Excel.

### 6. Role-Specific Functionality
- Tailor interactions based on user roles:
  - **End Users:** Focus on task-specific queries and operational summaries.
  - **Administrators:** Provide insights into configuration-related or system-specific document details.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Summarization should be completed within 30 seconds for documents up to 20 pages.
- Chat responses should be delivered within 2 seconds of receiving a query.

### 2. Scalability
- The module should handle multiple simultaneous summarization requests and chat interactions without performance degradation.

### 3. Security
- Ensure secure handling of document data and user queries in compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR.

### 4. Reliability
- Maintain an uptime of 99.9% to ensure consistent availability of the feature.

---

## Data Requirements
- **Training Data:** Sample documents for training the AI model, categorized by type.
- **Annotations and Metadata:** Refine summarization and query accuracy.
- **Logs:** User interactions for continuous improvement.

---

## API Requirements

### 1. Input
- **Document Content and Metadata:** For summarization.
- **User Query Text:** For chat interaction.

### 2. Output
- **Summarized Content:** The generated summary of the document.
- **Context-Aware Responses:** Answers to user queries based on the document.

### 3. Endpoints
- **Summarization Endpoint:** Accepts document content and metadata, returns a summary.
- **Query Endpoint:** Processes user questions and provides answers based on document content.

---

## Deliverables
- An AI module integrated with the ECM system for document summarization and interaction.
- APIs enabling seamless summarization and chat functionality.
- Documentation for API usage and retraining of the AI model.

---

## Success Metrics

### 1. Summarization Accuracy
- Achieve a summarization accuracy of 90%+ based on user feedback.

### 2. Query Response Accuracy
- Ensure 85%+ accuracy for document-based queries at launch.

### 3. Time Reduction
- Reduce time spent on manual document review by 50%.

## Stepwise Procedure for Implementation

### 1. **Requirement Analysis**
- Identify key features required for summarization and chat functionality.
- Gather sample documents, FAQs, and metadata for training.

### 2. **Data Preparation**
- Collect and preprocess training datasets (e.g., documents, annotations, user queries).
- Categorize documents based on type, complexity, and use case.

### 3. **AI Model Development**
- Develop and fine-tune AI models for:
  - Summarization: Extract concise summaries from documents.
  - Chat Interaction: Generate accurate, context-aware responses.

### 4. **API Development**
- Create APIs for:
  - Document Summarization.
  - Query Handling.
  - Feedback Collection.

### 5. **Integration with ECM System**
- Connect the AI module to the ECM system using APIs.
- Enable seamless communication between the ECM system and AI module.

### 6. **Role-Specific Functionality Customization**
- Configure the module to provide tailored responses based on user roles.
  - **End Users:** Focus on operational tasks.
  - **Administrators:** Provide system-level insights.

### 7. **Performance Optimization**
- Ensure summarization completes within 30 seconds for documents up to 20 pages.
- Reduce chat response time to under 2 seconds.

### 8. **Security and Compliance**
- Implement data encryption and secure API access.
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.

### 9. **Testing and Feedback**
- Test the AI module with real documents and user queries.
- Collect feedback on summarization accuracy and chat responses.

### 10. **Deployment and Monitoring**
- Deploy the AI module within the ECM system.
- Continuously monitor performance, uptime, and user feedback for improvements.
