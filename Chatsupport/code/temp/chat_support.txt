# Requirement Document for AI-Based Chatbot for Technical Support

## Project Title
AI Integration for Chatbot-Based Technical Support in ECM

## Objective
To implement an AI-driven chatbot that assists end users and ECM administrators with technical support while they perform their activities within the ECM system. The chatbot will provide real-time, context-aware guidance to reduce support tickets and improve user experience.

## Scope
The proposed chatbot will:
- Address common queries and provide actionable support using training data and user manuals.
- Operate seamlessly alongside ECM activities.
- Integrate with the ECM system via APIs for real-time contextual guidance.

### 4. API-Based Operation
- Use APIs for:
  - Accessing ECM activity logs for context.
  - Retrieving relevant documentation or predefined solutions.
  - Providing responses to user queries.

### 5. Feedback Loop for Improvement
- Capture user feedback on chatbot responses to improve accuracy and relevance.
- Utilize feedback for continuous learning and AI model refinement.

### 6. Multi-Language Support
- Support multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
- Allow users to configure their preferred language.

### 7. Role-Specific Responses
- Customize responses based on user roles:
  - **End Users:** Guidance on performing day-to-day tasks.
  - **Administrators:** Help with configuration, user management, and system settings.

### 8. Escalation to Support Team
- Provide an option to escalate unresolved issues to the support team.
- Include logs of user interactions to streamline issue resolution.
