### Documentation for Image Text Extraction Code

#### **Overview**
This script defines a function `extract_image_text` that is responsible for extracting text from an image file. It uses a pre-defined text extraction pipeline to process the image and retrieve the textual content.

---

### **Components**

#### **1. `create_text_extraction_pipeline`**
- **Source**: Imported from the `image` module.
- **Purpose**: Creates a pipeline that processes the image and extracts text.
- **Returns**: A pipeline object capable of processing images for text extraction.

#### **2. Function: `extract_image_text`**

##### **Parameters**:
- `image_path` (*str*): The file path to the image for text extraction.

##### **Process**:
1. **Create Pipeline**:
   - The function invokes `create_text_extraction_pipeline(image_path)` to initialize a pipeline specific to the provided image.

2. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Executes the pipeline using `.run()`.
   - The pipeline processes the image and returns an output, which is a structured dictionary containing extracted data.

3. **Extract Context**:
   - The function accesses the `task_output` field in the first item of the `image_output` list to retrieve the extracted text.
   - Retrieves the final content using `image_output.choices[0].message.content`.

##### **Returns**:
- A string containing the text extracted from the image.

##### **Code**:
```python
from image import create_text_extraction_pipeline

def extract_image_text(image_path):
    image_pipeline = create_text_extraction_pipeline(image_path)
    image_output = image_pipeline.run()
    image_context = image_output[0]['task_output']
    image_context = image_context.choices[0].message.content

    return image_context
```

---

### **Example Usage**
```python
from image import create_text_extraction_pipeline

# Example image path
image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"

# Extract text from the image
extracted_text = extract_image_text(image_path)
print("Extracted Text:", extracted_text)
```

---

### **Error Handling**
- **Potential Issues**:
  - If the `create_text_extraction_pipeline` function is not properly defined, the script will raise an ImportError.
  - If the pipeline output does not match the expected structure, an `IndexError` or `KeyError` could occur.

- **Suggestions**:
  - Validate `image_path` to ensure the file exists before passing it to the pipeline.
  - Add try-except blocks to gracefully handle exceptions during the pipeline execution or data extraction.

---

### **Future Improvements**
1. Add detailed error handling to manage cases where the pipeline fails or returns unexpected results.
2. Allow additional customization of the pipeline (e.g., different preprocessing options for different types of images).
3. Optimize performance for handling large images or batches of images.
